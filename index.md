## About Me

I am a Mechatronics Specialist with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and a Postgraduate Certificate in Industrial Automation. Passionate about robotics, I excel in integrating both hardware and software systems. My hands-on experience includes ROS 2, Gazebo simulation, Python programming, Fusion 360 CAD modeling, and embedded microcontroller development. I aspire to contribute as a versatile roboticist building intelligent autonomous systems.

## Featured Projects

### Obstacle Avoidance with LiDAR (ROS 2 + Gazebo)

This project simulates a two-wheeled differential drive robot equipped with a LiDAR sensor that autonomously avoids obstacles within a Gazebo environment. Using ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo Classic, the robot processes real-time laser scan data from the `/scan` topic and publishes velocity commands to `/cmd_vel` for smooth navigation. The setup includes a custom URDF/Xacro model and a detailed Gazebo world representing a cluttered environment.

- Developed custom robot model and integrated LiDAR sensor.
- Implemented obstacle detection and avoidance algorithms in Python.
- Designed simulation environment replicating real-world navigation challenges.

**Challenges faced:**

- Ensuring accurate sensor data processing and filtering for reliable obstacle detection.
- Tuning velocity commands to achieve smooth and safe robot movements.
- Configuring Gazebo plugins and model files for correct sensor simulation.

**Learning outcomes:**

- Mastered ROS 2 topics and message handling for real-time sensor and control data.
- Gained experience in Gazebo robot modeling and simulation environment setup.
- Enhanced understanding of autonomous navigation using LiDAR-based perception.

**Skills & tools used:**

- ROS 2 Humble, Python
- Gazebo Classic Simulation
- URDF / Xacro Robot Description
- LiDAR sensor integration
- Ubuntu Linux, Visual Studio Code
