## Featured Projects

### Wall Following Robot (ROS 2 + Gazebo)

This robot autonomously follows the wall using LiDAR data and ROS 2 nodes. The simulation is set in a maze-like Gazebo world, and the robot uses real-time perception to adjust its path and maintain proximity to the wall.

- Created a ROS 2 node to subscribe to LiDAR scan data and control robot movement.
- Tuned control logic to maintain a constant distance from the wall.
- Simulated robot behavior in a maze environment using Gazebo.

**Challenges faced:**  
- Maintaining stable distance in tight corners and noisy sensor data.  
- Filtering LiDAR data to avoid false positives.  
- Balancing velocity for smooth, safe navigation.

**Learning outcomes:**  
- Developed skills in sensor processing and feedback control.  
- Advanced ROS 2 node programming for navigation tasks.  
- Improved Gazebo environment setup and simulation design.
